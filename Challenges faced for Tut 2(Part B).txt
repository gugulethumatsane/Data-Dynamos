Compiling btop was actually not too bad — probably the easiest tutorial I’ve done so far. It had its challenges, but it wasn’t as hectic as the previous ones.The main issue I ran into was that my compiler was too old, so the build couldn’t go through. On top of that, my system time was off, which made things more confusing when trying to update stuff. Luckily, after a bit of Googling and asking ChatGPT for help, I managed to sort it all out.Overall, I learned a lot about how building from source works and how to fix random Linux problems.
