1)Challanges
i had to download the g++ compiler
I had to change the execute permision on the bash rc file

2)What did i learn
Fixing errors, i had to read the message and find a solution so essentially problem solving.
How software is installed in linux.

3)Impression
Theres a lot of commands that i didnt know which was a bit overwhelming but i think if you do it a thousand times you can get used to it.
